### Talk Goal

I want to empower Elixir champions to do an excellent job at getting new team members onboarded.

### High-Level Structure

- Do not assume they are enthusiasts.
- Help them see the benefits.
- Show them the ergonomics (the things that make developers happy). Docs, build tooling, test setup, etc.
- Things to set up before they even start. If possible, start them on something that already exists or something really small.
- Things they can ignore in the beginning.
- Things they need to start right away.
- Coding style with newcomers in mind.
	- Smaller units of work than you would normally do for new tech.
- Relate concepts to languages they are familiar with, when to break this rule. A module serves the same code organization use-case as a class would.
- Acknowledge some of the gotcha's like immutability and the different config files. Remind people not to feel bad if they tried to increment a variable in a loop, or mutate a variable in a block and expect it to be changed outside. _try this_ if you try to do some of these things, the compiler should try to help.
